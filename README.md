# C4L-Addons
The project "C4L Addons" are extensions for the basic version "Cloud4Log". The add-ons are the responsibility of T-Systems International.

Here it goes to ["API Dokumentation"](https://dls.addons.cloud4log.dev/api-docs/)

NEW!!! As of Release v1.3, electronic waybills (eCMR) can now also be used in our addons. To use it, please contact torsten.jaenicke-roessler@t-systems.com.

NEW: For the optimal analysis of the delivery notes with the help of our artificial intelligence, it is necessary to recommend guidelines for the content and structure of the delivery notes. The documentation is now available for companies: C4L_Addons_Request_for_Structure_DeliveryNotes_EN.pdf
